    "resources.faq.a2": "Switch when you see frequent tears, double-bagging, or delivery-route stress (sharp edges, heavy loads, stacked transport). Extra Heavy is usually cheaper than wasting two bags.",
    "resources.faq.q3": "What buffer should I use for monthly ordering?",
    "resources.faq.a3": "A typical buffer is 5â€“12% to cover rewraps, tears, and rush orders. Use the higher end if you do frequent delivery routes or high-volume weekends.",
    "resources.faq.q4": "How do I reduce returns and rework?",
    "resources.faq.a4": "Standardize sizes and hanger types, keep your top sellers always in stock, and match thickness to handling. Consistency is the fastest way to reduce mistakes.",
    "resources.faq.q5": "Can you recommend sizes + quantities for my shop?",
