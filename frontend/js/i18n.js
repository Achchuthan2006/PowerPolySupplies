    "resources.faq.a3": "A typical buffer is 5‚Äì12% to cover rewraps, tears, and rush orders. Use the higher end if you do frequent delivery routes or high-volume weekends.",
    "resources.faq.q4": "How do I reduce returns and rework?",
    "resources.faq.a4": "Standardize sizes and hanger types, keep your top sellers always in stock, and match thickness to handling. Consistency is the fastest way to reduce mistakes.",
    "resources.faq.q5": "Can you recommend sizes + quantities for my shop?",
